# Reinforcement Learning Trading Agent Project

This project demonstrates how to build a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to trade stocks using Deep Q-Networks (DQN). You will design, implement, and train a trading agent from scratch, using historical stock data and reinforcement learning techniques. The goal is to learn the RL pipeline, including data preprocessing, environment simulation, agent training, and evaluation.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing.

### Dependencies

The project requires the following Python libraries:

  - numpy
  - pandas
  - matplotlib
  - scikit-learn
  - keras
  - tensorflow
  - tqdm
  - IPython
